We're thrilled to welcome you to the new Social Impact Lab. For nine years, we've built and  grown FrontlineSMS, the world's most-used text messaging platform. But, we've been more than just a software organization at heart: our projects team has assembled subject-matter experts in fields ranging from radio to legal, and worked with organizations to help them not only implement FrontlineSMS and text messaging, but to develop and adopt inclusive technologies and attendant best practices. We're thrilled with what we've accomplished to date. Effectively, we've built a software company and a consultancy, together under one roof. Now, in order for each team to maximize their potential, we're reorganizing.

In the coming months, the software team will form a new entity, which will purchase the FrontlineSMS code from the Foundation. Freed of a development cycle driven by project-specific funding, the team will be able to focus all of its energies into making the Frontline suite of tools into the best solution for last-mile organizational processes, period.

The FrontlineSMS projects team will stay behind in the Foundation, and become Social Impact Lab. Our mission is to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient. We believe deeply that technology is utterly transformative to someone's individual livelihood, and are dedicated to creating systems that leave no one on the wrong side of the digital divide. From this new position, we can begin to meet the growing demands of our partners to advise them on how to incorporate technology throughout their work, instead of focusing on just one tool or solution. From our experience helping thousands of Frontline users, we're throwing ourselves at collecting, analyzing, and sharing as much relevant learning and documentation around inclusive technologies as we can get our hands on, with the hope of building a better, more informed community. We start today. In fact, we've already started.

As exciting as this moment is, it's the first of many to come. Over the coming weeks, we'll begin to fill out our new home on the web (pardon our dust); watch this space in the coming weeks for introductions to SIMLab's current sector focuses, and announcements of new ones. Towards the end of the year, we'll launch a new community-driven site for collecting and sharing learnings about implementing and maintaining inclusive systems (and, if you're interested in being a partner on this site, [give us a shout](mailto:hello@simlab.org)!).
