In September 2014, supported by funding from the United Nations Democracy Education Fund (UNDEF)  the [Governance Project](http://simlab.org/governance/) at [Social Impact Lab](http://simlab.org/) launched a new web platform for training and supporting civil society organizations on how to use inclusive technology in their work. 

The inaugural course supported 21 participants from 17 organizations across eight countries (mostly from across Africa and Asia) to plan for and use mobile technologies in their democracy, transparency, and accountability related work. UNDEF are supporting us to run several more courses like this throughout 2015.

Since NGOs and their staff are often stretched for both time and resources, we sought to design the course in a way that would adapt easily to busy schedules, tight budgets, and inconsistent connectivity levels. Technical demonstrations, shared as both video and audio, emphasized functional learning in the FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud platforms. Discussions, readings, and hangouts incorporated program design and planning cycle considerations in low cost, low bandwidth environments, including how the choice of communications platform can be inclusive or exclusive, and how to identify and mitigate risk. The final course module focused on monitoring and evaluation techniques for mobile-centered or mobile-enabled projects using SMS.

We also drew heavily on institutional knowledge from thousands of technical support questions answered on the FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud platforms along with experience conducting context and mobile infrastructure assessments, data integrity analyses, navigating non-governmental politics, and supporting SMS project planning in dozens of countries and sectors.  

We still have a lot of work to do to accommodate different connectivity levels, workstreams, and time constraints, and are grateful for the feedback the beta participants gave us on how to do so. A key challenge, and a key learning, is that it’s tough to teach an online course, using audio and video resources, on technology for low-bandwidth environments. For the future we’re challenging ourselves to come up with a way to provide interactive learning without demanding too much of our participants’ internet connections.

##What’s next?

Starting in early 2015, we’ll open registration for additional online trainings, demos, and platform-specific learning related to mobile- and inclusive-technologies.  In the meantime, we are working to integrate lessons learned from this ‘beta’ course into future iterations, and exploring subject matter for future courses.
