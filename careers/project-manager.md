SIMLab is a DC-based nonprofit. We help organizations use technology to build systems and services that are more accessible, responsive, and resilient.

We’re currently hiring for a project manager. Your primary responsibility will be the day-to-day management of the final year of a three-year project to use SMS to improve a land titling program in Odisha, India. As part of this responsibility, you will have the opportunity to find and execute other work around using inclusive technology to better deliver land titles.

You will report to the Head of Technology and Development to begin, and eventually report to a yet-to-be hired Head of Programs.
