categories: jobs
---
**Reports to:** ICT4COP Project Director  
**Type:** Fixed term contract  
**Duration:** 3-6 months  
**Location:** Flexible, but you must have the legal right to live and work in the UK and be able to extensively travel to the relevant areas.  
**Deadline for application:** We’ll be reviewing applications on a rolling basis, but would like to hire someone as soon as possible.  

SIMLab helps people and organizations to use inclusive technology in their social change work to make the systems they operate in and the services they provide more accessible, responsive, and resilient. We work to bring a spirit of experimentation and disciplined scaling to the good we try to do. SIMLab’s project implementation strategy focuses on holistically supporting local agents of change, who we believe are the key to sustainable and lasting social change.

SIMLab treats engagements not as one-off, siloed experiments, but as opportunities to advance the field. We emphasize shared learning, local ownership, and sustainability over scalability. Even for work that isn’t client-facing, we value thoughtful, sustainable, good work.

We're a small, close-knit team. Over time, you'll be given a lot of freedom and support, and we'll expect a lot in return. More than anything else, we're looking for someone who is excited to build something great, help solve a problem (or problems) you care about, and tell stories about the work we're doing.

## Project Background
SIMLab is seeking a Research Assistant to support us on conducting context assessments in Eastern Europe (Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia) as part of our ICT4COP project, which is part of a larger research consortium broadly focused on the issue of community policing in the following countries: Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. While inclusive technology is a central feature within the research agenda, researchers are also examining cross-cutting issues such as post-conflict security, chronic violence, and the role of formal and informal security providers, amongst other issues.

SIMLab’s role is to understand the inclusive technology context in each country, which will be followed by gathering ‘evidence’ through fieldwork in 2016. SIMLab’s fieldwork for inclusive technologies will be primarily qualitative, but will integrate a mixed-methods approach when possible. Qualitative interviews will be done in all countries to understand the inclusive technology research questions. In some cases, a survey tool will be developed to collect from a larger group of people from the community.

## Travel
This position will be required to travel within Eastern Europe (Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia) to undertake fieldwork and research activities. Travel and expenses will be covered under the project grant.

## Person Specification
The successful candidate will be equally able to support logistics around fieldwork as well as provide research assistance to both practitioners and researchers. With a wide range of responsibilities within the consortium, the Research Assistant will be responsible for working with academics, local partners, and police experts. They will work in close coordination with SIMLab staff to provide support to local fieldwork. Depending on the candidate, the Research Assistant may directly contribute to the writing of several SIMLab-authored reports which examine ground-level issues around community policing, technology, and human security.
