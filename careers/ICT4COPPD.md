Project Director for ICT4COP project on technology and community policing

**Reports to:** CEO
**Type:** Full-time
**Location:** Flexible, but you must have the legal right to live and work in the US or UK and be able to extensively travel to the relevant areas.  We prefer someone able to work from our Washington, DC-based office, but for the right applicant we will consider applicants from working from other locations.
**Deadline for application:** We’ll be reviewing applications on a rolling basis, but would like to hire someone as soon as possible.  

SIMLab helps people and organizations to use inclusive technology in their social change work to make the systems they operate in and the services they provide more accessible, responsive, and resilient. We work to bring a spirit of experimentation and disciplined scaling to the good we try to do. SIMLab’s project implementation strategy focuses on holistically supporting local agents of change, who we believe are the key to sustainable and lasting social change.

SIMLab treats engagements not as one-off, siloed experiments, but as opportunities to advance the field. We emphasize shared learning, local ownership, and sustainability over scalability. Even for work that isn’t client-facing, we value thoughtful, sustainable, good work.

We're a small, close-knit team. Over time, you'll be given a lot of freedom and support, and we'll expect a lot in return. More than anything else, we're looking for someone who is excited to build something great, help solve a problem (or problems) you care about, and tell stories about the work we're doing.

## Project Background
SIMLab is seeking a Project Director to lead our ICT4COP project, which is part of a larger research consortium broadly focused on the issue of community policing and human security  in the following countries: Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. While inclusive technology is a central feature within the research agenda, researchers are also examining cross-cutting issues such as post-conflict security, chronic violence, and the role of formal and informal security providers, amongst other issues.

SIMLab’s role is to understand the inclusive technology context in each country, which will be followed by gathering ‘evidence’ through fieldwork in 2016-2017. SIMLab’s primary deliverables include regional and country level Context Assessments and Country Reports that incorporate field-based findings with desk research. An initial desk-based context assessment report for each country will focus on the information and communications capabilities, usage patterns, infrastructure, regulatory policies, recent trends, public and private investments/interventions, and how this influences the use of inclusive technologies by communities and security services. Fieldwork will be conducted where possible, with site selection informed by conversations with researchers, work package leaders, and local partners. A final Country Report will be produced that synthesizes the Context Assessments with findings from fieldwork. Starting in 2017, learnings from the Context Assessments and implementation feasibility will inform the design and delivery of two pilots, one to be carried out in Kenya. Each pilot will be tailored to a specific context and community, aiming to ensure an intervention that is realistic in scope and is readily adopted by intended users. Partnerships with local institutions (community outreach, trainings, etc.) that might be needed as part of these pilots, will be explored by SIMLab. Once the two pilots have been decided upon, SIMLab staff will develop a thorough monitoring and evaluation plan for each pilot using our internal framework.

## Travel
This position will be required to travel within Europe, where most of our consortium partners are based, as well as within the target countries (depending on security situations at the time). Travel and expenses will be covered under the project grant. We estimate 20-40% travel.

## Person Specification

Experience of the role of technology platforms and initiatives in social change work, and an ability to navigate sensitive ethics and decision-making throughout the life of the research and project will be an advantage. The position entails coordinating and synthesizing findings from context assessment trips and desk research, managing remote research assistants and a Project Manager, translating findings into potential pilots, maintaining logistical and financial coordination, and reporting on the entire process.
