SIMLab is seeking proposals from technical or design firms.

Our preference is for the deliverables to all be completed by one firm, but we would consider proposals for individual deliverables, proposals from a consortium of organizations, and proposals from individual consultants.

We are interested in using this engagement to build relationships with design and technical partners for possible future work.

## About SIMLab
SIMLab is a DC-based non-profit. We help organizations use technology to build systems and services that are more accessible, responsive, and resilient.

## Deliverables
There are three primary categories of deliverables. We would be open to proposals that do not cover all three, but partial proposals must cover at least one primary deliverable.

### Design refresh and document templates
We are seeking a front-end design refresh. This would include the following:

* Web and print document templates, for short and long-form writing (e.g., blog posts, case studies, proposals, etc.). We expect that these templates would be usable by non-designer staff to create final documents.
* Color and typography style guide.
* Front-end web design refresh, if necessary. We use a Jekyll static site styled with SASS. We would prefer not to adopt a new CMS for the main site and blog.
* This would NOT entail changes to our basic logo or color scheme. We would be open to a refreshed SIMLab wordmark to pair with our main logo, but consider this optional.

### Low-bandwidth content optimization workflow
SIMLab works in a number of low-bandwidth contexts, and it is important that the work we produce be functionally accessible to people with poor connectivity. We are seeking proposals to build a workflow that can adapt a single document (for example, in Markdown) into multiple web and print templates, producing low-bandwidth versions by limiting custom fonts, compressing images, limiting visual effects, and reducing pagination.

###	Resource library design research and UX prototyping.
A core part of SIMLabâ€™s mission is sharing learning, in the form of case studies and other resources (both written and multimedia). As part of a project funded by the UN Democracy Fund, we have prototyped a resource library to manage content for courses we run on mobile technologies for civil society organizations. While this library has been useful in the context of our courses, scaling it will require a better user experience and better information architecture.

Our ideal version of this library would be usable across multiple SIMLab sites, with some organizing logic based on characteristics about the project.  We are interested in a brief design research and UX prototyping engagement to study how people in civic technology and international development find and use resources, and propose a guiding framework for how we should gather, organize, and present our resources.

We would also be open to platform suggestions to manage this content.

## Budget
We have $70,000 to spend on the total package of work. We are not obligated to select the least costly proposal.

## Timeline
Our deadline for completing this work is March 31, 2016. We realize this is an extremely compressed timeline. We ask that proposals be submitted by February 19, 2016. Please send questions and proposals to Keith Porcaro, keith@simlab.org.
