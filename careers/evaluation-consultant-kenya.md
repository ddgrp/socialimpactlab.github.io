##Background information

Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) helps people and organizations to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient. They support implementation, the sharing of learning and synthesis of best practice, and advocate to decision-makers and donors for policy-level change.

SIMLab defines inclusive technologies as those which embody values critical to truly scalable, locally-owned impact; accessibility, ease of use, interoperability, and sustainability. Mobile is a key example - SMS and voice telephony reach all of the world’s 3.6 billion mobile subscribers - as is radio, a critical technology for broad reach at relatively low cost. They also embrace both ends of the spectrum of inclusive tech - the increasing availability and affordability of cheap web-enabled phones and mobile data make them more accessible for relatively disconnected communities, and more analogue communications technologies, such as public criers, noticeboards and human networks, like religious structures and community leadership, reach into even the most remote and disconnected communities.  

This project is funded by the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID) under their Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF), through the Innovation Stream. The current political climate and results-based agenda demand a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of funds disbursed to ensure that they are managed to provide value for money.

TripleLine is currently the Fund Manager for the GPAF, but will be handing over to MannionDaniels during towards the end of the 2015, so the final report and evaluation of our project is likely to be affected. The Fund Manager is responsible for assessing performance of grantees at the project level. This evaluation will need to meet both DFID's requirements and SIMLab's needs as it seeks to learn from its first-ever directly implemented project.

##Project description

SIMLab’s Last Mile Mobile Money Project helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and under-resourced organizations explore available tools to realize the latent potential in mobile value transfer technologies for social change. SIMLab helped partners to break down barriers to innovation; both internally, through change management and business process consulting, and externally, through trainings on how to engage with and educate end-users to begin using accessible mobile money technologies. Through this project, SIMLab has been able to help organizations realize the uses and limitations of inclusive technologies and mobile money, while better understanding the types of organizational characteristics necessary in the implementation of digitization and cashless systems.

Since January 2014, SIMLab has been developing and testing Payments (a simple mobile money management technology based on FrontlineSMS technology), with 40 financial institutions, organizations, schools, and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in rural Kenya. Until December 2014, SIMLab was the institutional home of the FrontlineSMS project, which provided a suite of software that helps organizations build services with text messages. FrontlineSMS has now spun out as a separate, for-profit social enterprise and continues to own and operate the Payments platform, now in private beta. SIMLab’s intervention in this project sought to enable participating organizations to use Safaricom’s M-Pesa mobile money service at an enterprise scale, empowering them to provide critical services more efficiently and effectively to remote, rural and low-income populations.

M-PESA users last year sent 11 billion Kenya Shillings per month through the service, which has been transformative for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as urban to rural remittances. For the majority of businesses in Kenya, however, M-PESA seems still to be out of reach, although during the period of SIMLab’’s project, Safaricom has launched numerous products trying to gain traction in this market. SIMLab set out to explore whether providing a new type of platform to organizations like this could help them to implement mobile money, and in so doing, could improve economic livelihoods in rural Kenya. Our theory of change, essentially, was that mobile money could be a transformative tool for rural schools, NGOs, SMEs and Savings and Cooperative Credit Organizations (SACCOs), but that the lack of affordable offline management platforms was having a chilling effect. With a better platform and hands-on support to get started, organizations would be able to begin using mobile money and their end-users –– parents and children, beneficiaries, customers and borrowers –– would gain all the benefits of mobile money. An example might be a school or rural health clinic that wants to provide installment payment plans, or a rural MFI that wants to broker a microinsurance product to individuals alongside their group lending.

By far the largest challenge was to develop a recipe for transitioning different types of partners from cash to mobile payments. This required us to understand an organization’s operational and programmatic processes, and how existing processes could be adapted to encourage beneficiaries and clients to transition to using mobile payments. Trainings with partner organizations initially consisted of one- to two-day on-site sessions with critical members of staff, usually from finance, project and senior management. Trainings aimed to dive deeply into the organization’s programs and operations, come to a consensus about where mobile money should be piloted, set out roles and responsibilities in the roll-out of mobile money and provide an orientation to the Payments or PaymentView software. The evaluation will need to cover not just the technology implemented, but the important role played by this analysis and support.

##Purpose of the independent final evaluation

For SIMLab, the evaluation should provide an independent statement on the quality and outcomes of the project and help to identify and codify learning from the project and lessons that can be taken forward in the future. The evaluation will be shared under an open license on SIMLab's website, in hopes that it can inform donors, developers and implementers working in the wider field of ICT for Development. It will form the basis of a revision to the SIMLab case study on this project (Church, September 2015).

According to the agreement with DFID, the evaluation must be undertaken by an external evaluator, and must be submitted within 3 months of the project end-date of December 31, 2015. Thus the evaluation will take place in December 2015, with the final evaluation report submitted by March 31, 2016. For the Fund Manager, the independent final evaluation report will inform their understanding of the grantee’s performance at the project level and will also be used to inform the Evaluation Manager’s assessment of performance at the GPAF fund level.

The independent final evaluation report needs to be a substantial document that (a) answers all the elements of the Terms of Reference (ToR); (b) provides findings and conclusions that are based on robust and transparent evidence; and (c) where necessary supplements SIMLab’s own data with independent research.

#Deliverables and timeframe

The final evaluation consultant will submit the final report to SIMLab who, in turn, will submit it to DFID's then Fund Manager within three months of the project’s completion. DFID limits the length of the main body of the report (draft and final version) must be limited to 40 pages (this can include or exclude annexes). One of the annexes should consist of a table, which summarizes the findings according to the OECD-DAC criteria.

The evaluation will take place in early December 2015 with the draft report submitted to SIMLab by December 15th, 2015 for discussion and any additions/input. The final evaluation report will be submitted to SIMLab by December 22nd, 2015 or a date thereafter to be agreed with SIMLab following the evaluation visit, but no later than 15th January 2016.

Based on the available budget, it is assumed that the evaluators will spend no more than 2 days developing the evaluation approach and plan, 5 days conducting research on the ground, 3 days analyzing results and 3 days developing the draft report and 2 days to complete the final version of the evaluation report.

#Interested candidates are invited to send their CV and a proposal containing a clear methodology, a work plan and timeline, and a day rate for the work (exclusive of travel/visa/accommodation costs) to kelly@simlab.org no later than November 10th, 2015. We will be reviewing applications as they are received
