SIMLab was awarded a grant by the Department for International Development (DFID) Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF) to roll out our software product, FrontlineSMS with Payments, in Kenya. The project aims to enable small, rural organizations the ability to use mobile payments (M-PESA) through providing a software to send receive and manage bulk mobile payments and SMS notifications.   The project began in January of 2014 and we are looking for an experienced Program Manager who will be able to maintain the day-to-day management of the project, along with reflecting on and documenting the lessons learned throughout the project cycle. The last year has focused on redesigning business processes and end-user transitions from cash to mobile payments with 40 NGOs, schools and financial institutions and we expect the Program Manager will work closely with the organizations to continue the momentum in order to reach project targets. The majority of the role will entail management of the DFID project but there will also be opportunities for involvement in other SIMLab projects.
