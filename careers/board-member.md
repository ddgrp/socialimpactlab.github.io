Social Impact Lab is a non-profit consultancy. We help organizations use technology to make the systems they operate in and the services they provide more accessible, responsive, and resilient. We work to bring a spirit of experimentation and disciplined scaling to the good we try to do. 

We’re a small organization, with a relatively complex structure. However, after a complex few years we’ve invested heavily in streamlining procedures and financial structures. We need a Treasurer who will support the CEO and Finance and Ops Directors with high-level oversight and technical financial support, as well as carrying out fiduciary duties of the office of Treasurer.

Increasingly, SIMLab plays an important role in the ICT for development space as holistic thinkers, who recognize both the opportunities and the challenges – the barriers – to using mobile, and doing so effectively. We increasingly spend our time supporting a particular type of user: agents of change within their organization and their community, or capacity-builders supporting their networks to take up new technologies. Our Board members help us to refine this vision, to raise our profile on the world stage and creatively marshall resources to achieve our strategic goals. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to the work of an award-winning, dynamic, highly-respected technology-focused organization.

##Responsibilities
* Act as an ambassador for the organization, proactively engaging their networks to further the aims of SIMLab, growing our user and supporter base, helping identify opportunities and spreading the word about our work.
* In collaboration with the CEO, help to generate revenue through identifying, qualifying, cultivating, soliciting, and stewarding major individual donors, corporate, and/or foundation gifts, and fostering SIMLab’s overall financial health.
* Contribute actively to the Board’s role in giving firm strategic direction to SIMLab, setting overall policy, defining goals, setting targets and evaluating performance against agreed targets.
* Help to hold the CEO and management team to account for their performance, including in ensuring the financial stability and effective administration of SIMLab.
* Approve SIMLab’s annual budget, audit reports, and material business decisions; oversee the organization’s compliance with US (federal, state, and local), Kenya and UK financial legal requirements.
* Provide high-level oversight on financial analysis and forecasting, and effective financial procedures
* Helping to identify key funding needs and strategies, and support contingency planning for unforeseen circumstances;
* Lead on and enforce the implementation of effective financial procedures, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, and expense management.
* Support the Finance and Operations Director to manage SIMLab’s financial capital and determine the most effective capital structure of the social enterprise
* Review outcomes and metrics created by SIMLab for evaluating its impact, and regularly measuring its performance and effectiveness using those metrics.
* If possible, personally treat SIMLab as a top philanthropic priority reflected in an annual financial gift.
* Oversee the implementation of organization’s conflict of interest policy.
* Personally uphold and embody the good name and values of SIMLab.

##Board Terms
SIMLab’s Board Members serve a two-year term to be eligible for re-appointment for one additional term. Board meetings will be held half-yearly. Independent Board member appointments are staggered, with 50% of seats up for appointment each year.

##Time commitment
As a guide, Board members are expected to commit to two half-day meetings per year, with no more than one to be held in person, and to devote some time to additional review and discussion. The role will require someone who can allocate between one and three half days per month. The majority of this work can be carried out remotely. This time would be used to prepare for Board meetings, occasionally attend sub-committee meetings, and attend meetings, functions and events representing SIMLab.
