The Social Impact Lab (SIMLab), lowers the barriers to social change using mobile technologies. We work with organizations all over the world to make effective use of emerging technologies that increase the efficiency, reach, and accessibility of vital services, information, and goods. We build FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud, professional messaging platforms, support the application of our tools in a wide variety of contexts, and research the impact of digital tools and data. Our toolset and resources have been used by governments around the world to engage citizens, increase transparency, and extend accountability mechanisms using the world’s most-used digital communication tool: SMS.

New board members will join us at an exciting time. In 2013, the SIMLab Foundation celebrated its most successful year ever. We smashed our annual fundraising record, saw downloads of FrontlineSMS soar by over 600%, built a tight-knit and effective development team with a new CTO, and delivered FrontlineCloud for our social enterprise partner, the Community Interest Company (CIC). As we plan for growth in both sides of the business, with a strong focus on building sustainable product-based revenue through the CIC’s Cloud platform, it’s time for the Foundation to build on our strong position to clearly define its own agenda, and refocus on areas where it can add unique value, to the SIMLab group and to our users and community.

Increasingly, SIMLab plays an important role in the ICT for development space as holistic thinkers, who recognize both the opportunities and the challenges – the barriers – to using mobile, and doing so effectively. We increasingly spend our time supporting a particular type of user: agents of change within their organization and their community, or capacity-builders supporting their networks to take up new technologies. Our Board members help us to refine this vision, to raise our profile on the world stage and creatively marshall resources to achieve our strategic goals. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to the work of an award-winning, dynamic, highly-respected technology-focused organization.
