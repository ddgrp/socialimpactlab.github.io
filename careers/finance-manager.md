Based: Ideally Washington, DC, but could be remote after an initial period.  
Reports to: CEO

We’re a small organization, with a relatively complex structure, so what we save by having few transactions we make up for in rebilling and accounting. However, after a complex few years we’ve invested heavily in streamlining procedures and financial structures, so that it’s likely that the financial responsibilities outlined in the job description below may in future amount to no more than 60% of the role.

Going forward, we hope that the person filling this role may take on more involvement in procurement and contracting, grant proposal budgeting, and general operations, and we have amended the title accordingly.
