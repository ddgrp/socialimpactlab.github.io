#About SIMLab
Social Impact Lab is non-profit that works to advance the ethical use and deployment of low-end technologies for greater inclusion of offline populations. We support adoption and sustained use of inclusive technologies, often involving non-tech approaches and considerations including people, policy, and power dynamics.  SIMLab works directly with organizations on programs and planning as well as conducting research at a systems level to understand and better advocate for structural changes along the same lines. Beyond adoption and use of technology, we prioritize data ethics, human rights and structural inclusion in all the work we do.  
 
SIMLab emerged out of FrontlineSMS, a mobile telecommunications management platform  used in 100+ countries, by organizations ranging from small community health providers to large international election monitoring initiatives among many others. Based in Washington, DC, London and Nairobi, we work in multiple time zones, across a range of sectors, and in urban and rural areas alike. 

#About the Position and Research
We are hiring a senior research and information and communications technology (ICT) lead, who would both plan for and oversee the coordination of multi-country, multi-partner consortium investigating the role of ICTs and innovation in conflict-affected countries. In collaboration with the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), SIMLab has been selected to oversee all aspects of technology research, design, and potential development in a project that will investigate the role of ICTs and innovation in increasing human security and improving community-police relations in highly sensitive, active conflict or post conflict settings.  

The role of the senior research and ICT lead will involve all aspects of research planning, management, and oversight, with more guidance and supervision in the early phases of methodological development, and increased autonomy over the life of the 3.5 year project. While experience with technology in conflict-environments is essential, we welcome critical approaches regarding the role of technology platforms and initiatives and will rely heavily on the research lead to navigate sensitive ethics and decision-making throughout the life of the research and project.   The position additionally entails coordinating and synthesizing research findings, translating them into potential pilots and maintaining logistical and financial coordination and reporting of the entire process.
