Technologies for civic dialogue, inclusion, and oversight are evolving with increasing speed. As a result, they rely on digital platforms, excluding some populations by design. While civic technologies aimed at simplifying systems and bridging information divides are proliferating; the number of people represented by associated political decisions, governance objectives, and policy outcomes may be shrinking.

Additionally, in governance among other areas, accountability is often an assumed byproduct of transparency. Yet accountability refers to many things, from the buses running on time to ensuring that public officials are held to the same legal standards as lay people to knowing that municipal budgetary commitments have sufficient technical capacity to be met.  Technological innovation and digital platforms are proliferating in support of citizen reporting and availability of open data. Fewer are emerging to connect the various people, processes, and questions that shorten the distance between information transparency and accountable behavior, decision-making, and service delivery.

SIMLab's Governance work focuses on how mobile technologies and low cost ICTs can be used to improve accountability, facilitate better public and service deliveries for cities, build governance structures that go beyond governments, and establish strong data ethics standards for government and development work.
