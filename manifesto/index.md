#We believe in inclusion through technology

Technology is rewriting relationships between individuals, communities, and governments. Better services for all are within reach today, and it doesn’t require the ever-shifting cutting edge, accessible to only a few. For a person on the margins of society, the move from analog to digital is transformative, even if the technology is not new. Radio, low-end mobile, even trust networks all reach more people than smartphones, all over the world.

Social Impact Lab exists to help everyone realize this potential, no matter their level of connectivity. We’ve seen first-hand the challenges and benefits of implementing even simple technology in the last-mile. Our experience has led us to develop a holisic set of characteristics shared by inclusive systems. We seek to foster them in all the work that we do. We believe in systems that are:


##Local
Inclusive systems incorporate local ownership and meaningful community agency in their design, implementation, and evolution.

##Responsible
Inclusive systems manage data responsibly and understand the risks involved. They require informed consent from users, meet the highest ethical standards, and comply with regulations.

##Interoperable
Inclusive systems use standard formats and APIs, for easy interoperability and systems integration as the context around them changes.

##Sustainable
Inclusive systems have sustainable business models, and are implemented with organizational change and development in mind.

##Monitored
Inclusive systems are monitored, both for the direct impact of the system, and the indirect impact of any externalities that technology introduces.

##Realistic
Inclusive systems incorporate hardware and operational relationships that are appropriate and achievable even in the most challenging contexts.
