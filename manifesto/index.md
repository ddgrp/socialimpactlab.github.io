#We believe in inclusion

Technology is rewriting relationships between individuals, communities, and governments. Better services for all are within reach today, and it doesn't require the ever-shifting cutting edge, accessible to only a few. For a person on the margins of society, the move from analog to digital is transformative. Social Impact Lab exists to help everyone realize this potential, no matter their level of connectivity.

#We work holistically

Communities don't exist in vacuums, and neither do our projects. We investigate the complete context around a technology implementation, from a person's daily routine to the reliability of the national energy grid, and ask not only "how?", but "why?". In short, we build systems that fit.

#We build to last

A project's legacy doesn't end when the last report is filed. We uncover and account for unexpected aftereffects of introducing new technology and systems. Throughout, we capture and document learning, and share our results with policymakers, and implementers, and the public, so that progress made does not become progress lost.
