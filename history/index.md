Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile. It grew out of the FrontlineSMS project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005, a suite of software that helped organizations professionally manage text messages. Throughout our history, we’ve put the users of our products at the center of our work, embedding with them on projects, sharing our learning with guides and case studies, and developing technologies that help organizations all over the world use SMS in their work. FrontlineSMS has been downloaded over 200,000 times and is in use in more than 135 countries. SIMLab’s impact has been recog-nized by the NGO community at large: in 2013, The Global Journal named us the #1 Tech NGO in the world, and we received a Google Impact Award jointly with Landesa. In 2011, SIMLab was awarded the Curry Stone Design Prize. 

As FrontlineSMS flourished, so too did our practice of providing hands-on support and advice to our users, and collating and sharing as much of that learning as we could. Our work transcended sector and geographic borders, enabling us to develop broadly applicable lessons about how technology implementations in the last mile ought to work. We have contributed to important ICT4D (ICT for development) and M4D (mobile for development) debates, as those sectors argua-bly approach the twilight of a phase replete with pilot projects and proof-of-concept systems, with few methodologies sufficient to evidence impact, and with donors continuing to prioritize new, implementation-focused, sector-specific ideas. 

In order to grow the Frontline suite of tools even further, our software team formed a new, for-profit entity, and bought the core FrontlineSMS code base from SIMLab. Releasing Frontline to a dedicated software company frees SIMLab to broaden its tools and vision beyond SMS and the Frontline product set, and to deliver on its mission to develop inclusive systems more completely.
