Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile&mdash;it grew out of the [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com) project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005. With more than 200,000 downloads in 199 territories, FrontlineSMS helps tens of thousands of organizations reach tens of millions of people, customizing and owning their own content, engagement, and relationships in sectors ranging from health, to financial services, to conservation.

Throughout our history, we’ve put the users of our products at the center of our work, embedding with them on projects, sharing our learning with guides and case studies, and developing technologies that help organizations all over the world use SMS. SIMLab’s impact has been recognized by the NGO community at large: in 2013, The Global Journal named us the #1 Tech NGO in the world, and we received a Google Impact Award jointly with Landesa. In 2011, SIMLab was awarded the Curry Stone Design Prize.

As FrontlineSMS flourished, so too did our practice of providing hands-on support and advice to our users, and collating and sharing as much of that learning as we could. Our work transcended sector and geographic borders, enabling us to develop broadly applicable lessons about how technology implementations in the last mile ought to work. We’ve learned that getting the technology up and running is only a small part of what makes a successful project: issues like impact measurement, managing risk, sustainable rollout, and effective messaging end up being critical. We've also learned that systems design is as much about philosophy as technology and that strong relationships are the bedrock of both approaches. We have contributed to important ICT4D (ICT for development) and M4D (mobile for development) debates, as those sectors arguably approach the twilight of a phase characterized by pilot projects and proof-of-concept systems, with few methodologies sufficient to evidence impact, and with donors continuing to prioritize new, implementation-focused, sector-specific ideas.

In late 2014, the Frontline team will set up its own company, and will be seeking investment. Our hope is to move from project-driven funding to product and subscription revenue, enabling us to truly focus on the needs and development priorities of our diverse user base. Similarly, the Frontline product suite will continue to evolve beyond the inbox, including more complex processes, better connections to other systems, and an increasing number of data channels, from missed calls to mobile payments. Frontline started as a solution to reach and empower last mile organizations, the next chapter of our growth will connect those digital frontiers to global systems and supply chains. 

SIMLab builds accessible, responsive, and resilient systems, helping users and customers solve both the tech and the analog obstacles along the way. We believe that systems work best when they're inclusive, which implicates a wide range of tools. SMS is powerful because of its broad reach, relatively low cost, reliance on existing infrastructure, and common data format. Other technologies, like radio, voice telephony, even blackboards and megaphones, meet some of these criteria and together can be knit together to extend to last mile systems. SIMLab has a long history of building systems that work beyond where the asphalt ends, using inclusion to create human readable systems that build impact through participation.
