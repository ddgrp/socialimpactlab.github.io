Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) began life as a foundation with a mission to lower barriers to social change through mobile. It grew out of the [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com) project, founded by Ken Banks in 2005. With more than 200,000 downloads in 199 territories, FrontlineSMS supports tens of thousands of organizations to reach tens of millions of people. Organizations to customize and own their own content, engagement, and relationships in sectors ranging from health, to election monitoring, to conservation.

Throughout our history, we’ve put the users of our products at the center of our work, embedding with them on projects, sharing our learning with guides and case studies, and developing technologies that help organizations all over the world use SMS. SIMLab’s impact has been recognized by the NGO community at large: in 2013, The Global Journal named us the #1 Tech NGO in the world, and we received a Google Impact Award jointly with Landesa. In 2011, SIMLab was awarded the Curry Stone Design Prize.

As FrontlineSMS flourished, so too did our practice of providing hands-on support and advice to our users, and collating and sharing as much of that learning as we could. Our work transcended sector and geographic borders, enabling us to develop broadly applicable lessons about how technology implementations in the last mile ought to work. We’ve learned that getting the technology  to work is only a small part of what makes a successful technology project - issues like impact measurement, managing risk, sustainable rollout, and effective messaging. We have contributed to important ICT4D (ICT for development) and M4D (mobile for development) debates, as those sectors arguably approach the twilight of a phase replete with pilot projects and proof-of-concept systems, with few methodologies sufficient to evidence impact, and with donors continuing to prioritize new, implementation-focused, sector-specific ideas.

In order to grow the Frontline suite of tools even further, our software team are forming a new, for-profit entity, and will take FrontlineSMS on the next stage of its journey, continuing to support mobile information and communications all over the world. For the SIMLab team, our new independence gives us more time to focus on helping address the persistent challenges of implementation, and to broaden our tools and vision beyond SMS and the Frontline product set.
