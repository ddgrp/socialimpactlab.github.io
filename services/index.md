#Implementation
We design, implement and measure the impact of inclusive technology projects, and explore new ways that technology can support project work. We work with partners and donors in any and every stage of the implementation process, from the first call for proposals to the final evaluation study. We specialize in organizational and implementation strategy, project execution and delivery, context assessments, technology trainings, baseline studies, and troubleshooting technology platforms.

#Guides, tools and documentation
We draw on our experience and those of our partners to gather and freely publish case studies, meta-evaluations, best practice toolkits and technology guides. To help organizations achieve internal buy-in, we help agents of change to make the case for innovation with written, audio-visual, and data resources. 

#Policy and advocacy
Our experience guiding users and implementing projects has given us a strong, informed perspective on best practices from project implementers, donors, and technology organizations. We work with marginalized communities around the world, to provide them the resources they need to make the case for and execute change, both within their own communities and with the organizations that influence them.
