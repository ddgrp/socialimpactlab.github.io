## {% include html/sectionlink link="section1" %}First Steps with Frontline

This module gives an overview of the Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) and Mobile for Development (M4D) fields, as well as a practical introduction to the Frontline product suite and what you’ll need to start planning a project with it.  It will draw on examples and debates related to democracy, transparency, accountability, and civic engagement. It will focus on the uses and the challenges of using different technologies, including mobile, in project planning.

<li>How to participate in the class discussion by joining the email listserv</li>

## Do: your assignments for the first week!

Welcome to the course! We hope you enjoy reviewing the materials we’ve picked for you, and are looking forward to your participation!

This course will run a new module every one or two weeks. Each module will include reading(s), an audio-visual resource, discussion tasks over the class email listserv, and a technical walkthrough (posted as a video and audio file) with accompanying technical tasks for the week. These first two modules are two weeks long each, so that you have plenty of time to get set up. After that, we’ll have three one week modules to dive a bit more in-depth into the software functions and project planning.

In addition, we will hold an hour-long clinic over Skype once a week, where we can answer your questions in real time, discuss your reading and activities for the week, and meet others who are using FrontlineSMS and similar software in their work.

To get started:

Create your profile.

You can do this by clicking on the pink button in the upper-right hand corner on the home page, labeled “Your Profile.”

If you haven’t done so already, you can upload a photo to your user profile using Gravatar. Make sure you use the same email that you have used to register with this course site.

Introduce yourself over the email listserv.

We will be using an email listserv for class discussion and participation: <a href="mailto:fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com">fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com</a>. Invitations to join the Google Group listserv will be sent to the email you submitted in your application for this listserv. If you have an alternative email you’d prefer to use, let us know!

Please accept your invitation to join and then write a paragraph or two to introduce yourself to the rest of the class- where you work and what you do there, where you live, how you would like to use technology, hobbies, and anything else you’re willing to share.

Check your email to ‘meet’ your fellow students!

Suggest case studies your classmates can read and comment on the video and article we posted!

Many of you have already heard about some ways low-tech mobile can be used by civil society. Post your suggestions, favorite case studies, or stories about how you’ve used mobile in your work in the past over the <a href="mailto:fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com">fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com listserv</a>.

##  Read: an introduction to the ethos and power of FrontlineSMS {% include html/sectionlink link="section3" %}

This article from 2011 outlines how FrontlineSMS has been used all over the world, and makes the case for last-mile mobile.

What do you think makes the Frontline approach powerful? What are the challenges? What are other platforms you’ve heard about? Discuss your impressions over our listserv by emailing <a href="mailto:fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com">fall-2015-mobile-cso-course@googlegroups.com</a>.

This course is unique in that it focuses on learning about a specific tool set, the Frontline product suite.  However, there are many other M4D and ICT4D tools out there and several tools directories, although the challenge with them is that while technologies evolve and are updated very rapidly, the directories are not. Sometimes features have been added and bugs have been fixed, but are not reflected in the directories.  We’ve linked a few here, but you will want to be wary about the information presented in them.
